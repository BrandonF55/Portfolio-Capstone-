# Over View Of the Project.

My portfolio project will be a web application that showcases my design skills and coding abilities. The primary technologies you plan to use are CSS, HTML, and JavaScript, and I aim to incorporate animation throughout the project to make it visually engaging and interactive.

The portfolio project will include sections highlighting my skills, experience, and education. I plan to use my design skills to create a visually appealing layout that is easy to navigate and showcases my work in the best possible light. The portfolio will also include a section for projects I have completed, featuring images, descriptions, and links to the code repositories on my GitHub account.

To add interactivity and make my portfolio stand out, I plan to incorporate animations and special effects throughout the project, using CSS and JavaScript. I want a portfolio to be engaging and memorable, leaving a lasting impression on anyone who visits it.

In addition to showcasing my design and coding skills, you also plan to include links to my GitHub and LinkedIn profiles. This will allow potential employers and clients to easily access my work and connect with you professionally. By presenting a professional and engaging online presence, you hope to attract new opportunities and advance my career as a web developer.
